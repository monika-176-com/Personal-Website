    <li> File Encryption and Decryption : This project demonstrates how to secure a file by encrypting its contents and later decrypting it back using
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. Encryption makes the data unreadable, and
        decryption restores it to its original form. This is particularly useful for protecting sensitive information.
        Basically, it uses the features of OOP like Encapsulation, Modularity, Scalability.</li>
